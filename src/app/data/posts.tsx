        <p>
          In Traditional Chinese Medicine, insomnia is often viewed as an
          imbalance between yin and yang energies, particularly affecting the
          Heart and Liver organs. Unlike Western medicine, TCM doesn't just
          focus on the symptoms but looks at the underlying patterns causing
          sleep disturbances.
        </p>

        <p>Common TCM patterns associated with insomnia include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Heart and Spleen Deficiency: Often manifesting as difficulty falling
            asleep, accompanied by anxiety and poor appetite
          </li>
          <li>
            Liver Fire Rising: Characterized by irritability, vivid dreams, and
            difficulty staying asleep
          </li>
          <li>
            Heart and Kidney Disharmony: Results in frequent waking during the
            night and night sweats
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          TCM practitioners typically recommend a combination of acupuncture,
          herbal remedies, and lifestyle modifications. Common herbs used
          include Suan Zao Ren (Sour Jujube Seeds) and An Mian Pian, a
          traditional formula for sleep support. Additionally, gentle exercises
          like Tai Chi and Qi Gong, practiced in the early evening, can help
          regulate the body's natural sleep-wake cycle.

    title: "Understanding Digestive Health",

      "Explore how TCM views digestive health as central to overall wellbeing, with the Spleen and Stomach playing crucial roles in transforming food into Qi and Blood...",

        <p>
          Traditional Chinese Medicine views digestive health as central to
          overall wellbeing. The Spleen and Stomach are considered the primary
          organs responsible for digestion, not just of food but also of
          thoughts and emotions. When these organs are in harmony, they
          efficiently transform food into Qi and Blood.
        </p>
        <p>TCM recognizes several common digestive patterns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Spleen Qi Deficiency: Results in fatigue, loose stools, and poor
            appetite
          </li>
          <li>
            Stomach Heat: Causes acid reflux, burning sensation, and excessive
            hunger
          </li>
          <li>Cold Dampness: Leads to bloating, heavy sensation, and nausea</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Treatment approaches typically include dietary therapy, with an
          emphasis on eating warm, cooked foods and avoiding cold or raw foods
          that can burden the digestive system. Specific herbs like Ginger
          (Sheng Jiang) and Peppermint (Bo He) are often prescribed. Acupuncture
          points along the Stomach and Spleen meridians can help strengthen
          digestive function and resolve stagnation.

    title: "Managing Stress Through TCM",
    excerpt:
      "Learn how TCM associates stress with disruption of Qi flow and how traditional techniques like acupuncture and herbs can help restore balance...",

        <p>
          In TCM philosophy, stress is often associated with disruption of the
          free flow of Qi (vital energy) throughout the body. This stagnation
          particularly affects the Liver system, which is responsible for
          maintaining smooth Qi flow and emotional balance.
        </p>

        <p>TCM identifies several manifestations of stress:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Liver Qi Stagnation: The most common pattern, causing irritability,
            mood swings, and physical tension
          </li>
          <li>
            Heart and Kidney Disharmony: Leading to anxiety, palpitations, and
            sleep disturbances
          </li>
          <li>
            Spleen Qi Deficiency: Resulting in worry, overthinking, and
            digestive issues
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Treatment strategies often combine various modalities. Acupuncture is
          particularly effective at moving stagnant Qi and calming the mind.
          Herbs like Xiao Yao San (Free and Easy Wanderer) help soothe the Liver
          and reduce stress. Mind-body practices such as meditation and
          breathing exercises are also essential components of stress management
          in TCM.
